A list of resources for metadata tools, standards and development.  [Contributions](https://github.com/stevetsa/awesome-metadata/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md) welcome!

## Framework
(Sort alphabetically.)    
\[Resource](URL) - description.  

[ISA-Tab](https://isa-tools.github.io/index.html) - The open source ISA framework and tools help to manage an increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employing one or a combination of technologies. Built around the 'Investigation' (the project context), 'Study' (a unit of research) and 'Assay' (analytical measurement) data model and serializations (tabular, JSON and RDF), the ISA framework helps you to provide rich description of the experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.

[caDSR](https://cbiit.cancer.gov/ncip/biomedical-informatics-resources/interoperability-and-semantics/metadata-and-models)- caDSR comprises a database, application programming interfaces (APIs), and web-based applications for creating, editing, controlling, deploying, monitoring, and finding reusable metadata. These metadata describe common data elements (CDEs), information models, and case-report forms (CRFs) that are used for data collection and analysis or for software development.

## Model
(Sort alphabetically.)    
\[Resource](URL) - description.   

[ISA Abstract Model](http://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) - This ISA specification defines an Abstract Model of the metadata framework. The ISA Abstract Model has been implemented in two format specifications, ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON, both of which have supporting tools and services associated with them. The format specifications are also available for additional tooling to take advantage of ISA-formatted content.



## Tools
(Sort alphabetically.)

[ISA-tools](https://isa-tools.github.io/software-suite.html) - A set of tools for ISA-Tab and model.

[MetaROOT](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/MetaROOT) - Using MetaMapLite to standardize metadata terminology and make sequencing metadata machine readable.  


## Metadata/Data Standard Hackathons and Tool Development

[IEEE Hackathon on Big Data Governance and Metadata and Management](https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/bdgmm_compsac2018.html) -  Tokyo, Japan - July 23, 2018 - develop interoperable data infrastructure for Big Data Governance and Metadata Management that is scalable and can enable the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability between heterogeneous datasets from various domains without worrying about data source and structure. Keywords: cancer, genomics, precision medicine.

[Bio-IT World FAIR Data Hackathon](http://www.bio-itworldexpo.com/fair-data-hackathon/) - Boston, MA - May 14 - 15, 2018 - 
The second annual Bio-IT FAIR Data Hackathon will unite life science and IT teams to tackle actual genomic datasets with maximum impact potential. The hackathon will have an initial focus on evaluating the FAIRness of a range of different data sets. The second stage will involve teams, each working with a different data set, developing approaches to improve the FAIRness of that dataset through the use of unique identifiers, linking to additional data sets, collection of appropriate metadata, and other techniques that can be applied.

[NIH Data Science Collaborative Hackathon](https://ncbi-hackathons.github.io/) - Bethesda, Maryland - April 16 â€“ 18, 2018 - The hackathon will focus on tools for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. [Product - MetaROOT](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/MetaROOT)   

[IEEE metadata hackathon and workshop](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2018/cancelled-ieee-metadata-hackathon-and-workshop-berlin) - Berlin, Germany - March 19, 2018 - CANCELLED This two-day event will consist of two parallel 24-hour hackathon tracks and a plenary workshop session on big data governance and metadata management. CLARIN organises one hackathon track, which revolves around the analysis, curation, processing, presentation and management of metadata for resources relevant to the social sciences and humanities.  [Product](https://github.com/clarin-eric/ieee-metadata-hackathon).  


## Other resources
[RDA Metadata Directory](http://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/) - The RDA Metadata Standards Directory Working Group is supported by individuals and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and use of metadata for scientific data. The overriding goal is to develop a collaborative, open directory of metadata standards applicable to scientific data can help address infrastructure challenges.
