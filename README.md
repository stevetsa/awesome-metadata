## Framework

[Resource](URL) - description.   

[ISA-Tab](https://isa-tools.github.io/index.html) - The open source ISA framework and tools help to manage an increasingly diverse set of life science, environmental and biomedical experiments that employing one or a combination of technologies. Built around the 'Investigation' (the project context), 'Study' (a unit of research) and 'Assay' (analytical measurement) data model and serializations (tabular, JSON and RDF), the ISA framework helps you to provide rich description of the experimental metadata (i.e. sample characteristics, technology and measurement types, sample-to-data relationships) so that the resulting data and discoveries are reproducible and reusable.



## Model

[ISA Abstract Model](http://isa-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/isamodel.html) - This ISA specification defines an Abstract Model of the metadata framework. The ISA Abstract Model has been implemented in two format specifications, ISA-Tab and ISA-JSON, both of which have supporting tools and services associated with them. The format specifications are also available for additional tooling to take advantage of ISA-formatted content.

[IEEE Hackathon on Big Data Governance and Metadata and Management](https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/bdgmm_compsac2018.html) -  Tokyo, Japan - July 23, 2018 - develop interoperable data infrastructure for Big Data Governance and Metadata Management that is scalable and can enable the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability between heterogeneous datasets from various domains without worrying about data source and structure. Keywords: cancer, genomics, precision medicine.

[NIH Data Science Collaborative Hackathon](https://ncbi-hackathons.github.io/) - Bethesda, Maryland - April 16 â€“ 18, 2018 - The hackathon will focus on tools for advanced analysis of biomedical datasets including text, images, next generation sequencing data, proteomics, and metadata. [Product]()   

[IEEE metadata hackathon and workshop](https://www.clarin.eu/event/2018/cancelled-ieee-metadata-hackathon-and-workshop-berlin) - Berlin, Germany - March 19, 2018 - CANCELLED This two-day event will consist of two parallel 24-hour hackathon tracks and a plenary workshop session on big data governance and metadata management. CLARIN organises one hackathon track, which revolves around the analysis, curation, processing, presentation and management of metadata for resources relevant to the social sciences and humanities.

## Other resources
[RDA Metadata Directory](http://rd-alliance.github.io/metadata-directory/) - The RDA Metadata Standards Directory Working Group is supported by individuals and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and use of metadata for scientific data. The overriding goal is to develop a collaborative, open directory of metadata standards applicable to scientific data can help address infrastructure challenges.
